MATLAB Code : ([requires NIRFAST](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nir/nirfast/))

This MATLAB code is used as part of the work presented in:

Calvin B. Shaw, Zhiqiu Li, Brian W. Pogue, and Phaneendra K. Yalavarthy, â€œDirect sensitivity based data-optimization strategy for image guided diffuse optical tomography," Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics (JSTQE), 22(3), 6803709 (2016).

MATLAB implementation of direct sensitivity based optimal selection of independent measurements(proposed): reconstruct_stnd_cw_region_direct_sensitivity.m
